# [Container with Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
## Description
```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, 
which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

## Example
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

Output: 49
```

## Strategy
We could again use nested loop but it is too time consuming even if applied with some optimization method (like limit the iteration range). 
So the best method would be using 2 indexes to push from the head and the tail of the array. The idea is in order for it to comtain more water, 
with width going down, the heigh must goes up. 

Once you think about this method, the code is just too easy. The process of this kind of thinking is what I need to train later on.

## Keys
* Use 2 indexes

## Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int m_area = 0;
        int lefty = 0;
        int righty = height.size() - 1;
        while (lefty < righty) {
            m_area = max(m_area, (righty - lefty) * min(height[lefty], height[righty]));
            if (height[lefty] < height[righty])
                lefty++;
            else
                righty--;
        }
        return m_area;
    }
};
```
