Dear Professor Boye,

It's been a long time! Hope everything went well will you this summer. The project with Gabriel regarding Furhat Robotics is coming to an end and 
I would like to express my gratitude again for recommending me to this great opportunity!

As you probably know it's time for master program application and it would be of great help if you could spare some time and write me a recommendation
letter. I think we already talked about this before and Dymitro said he already gave you a summary about my academic performances during the two courses? 
Do you need further information about me to write the letter?

Thanks again for your time! I'm also applying for KTH so perhaps I could thank you in person next year!
