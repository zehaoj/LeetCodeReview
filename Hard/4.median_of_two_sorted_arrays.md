# [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

## Description
```
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
```

## Example
```
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0

Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

## Strategy
This is indeed a hard problem. There are two parts that might pull us back: using the basic concept of median, and edge cases. Currently I'm not sure if it's the common case since I haven't 
finished too many problems, but I found out that for array problems, a commonplace is to use left and right index.

So is this one.
