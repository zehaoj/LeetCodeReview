# [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)
## Description
```
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.
```

## Example
```
Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```

## Strategy
This has nothing to do with time complexity optimization. This is a pure IQ test problem, and I failed it...

The below gif really explained the whole process. After understanding it, the code is just one step away.

## Keys
* Use a lot of samples to test and find patterns
* This is why we train on LeetCode -- there is no way I can solve this one in a 20-min-interview without seeing it before

## Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int> &num) {
        if (num.size() <= 1) 
            return;
        int i = num.size() - 1, j;
        for(j = num.size() - 2; j >= 0; j--){
            if(num[j] < num[j+1]) 
                break;
        }
        if (j >= 0) {
            while (num[i] <= num[j])
                i--;
            swap(num[i], num[j]);
        }
        reverse(num.begin() + j + 1, num.end());
        // sort is also acceptable, faster than reverse
        // sort(num.begin() + j + 1, num.end());
    }
};
```
