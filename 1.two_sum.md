# [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
## Discription
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
```

## Examples
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Strategy
### Strategy 1
The first and easiest thought was to use nested loop to iterate through all the elements. 
It is obviously a doable solution, with time coplexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), which is not ideal.

### Strategy 2
**You can always consider optimize the searching step!**

C++, Java, Python and a lot of languages provide easy ready-to-use ways to search in O(log(n)) time. Basically instead of iterating over all the elements 
again in order to find the one, we could try to trade space for time, by storing the array into another data structure that comes with fast look up. 
And here we could use std::unordered_map.

|   | map  | unordered_map 
:---:|:----:|:----:
Ordering        | increasing  order   | no ordering
Implementation  | Self balancing BST, like Red-Black Tree  | Hash Table
Search time     | log(n)              | O(1) -> Average, O(n) -> Worst Case
Insertion time  | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search
Deletion time   | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search

Since we don't really need the elements to be orederd, we could use unordered_map in this case for faster search time. 

## Keys
* Use built-in container for faster search
* Trade space for time
* Use map to store value and index

## Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++)
            map[nums[i]] = i;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            auto result = map.find(target - nums[i]);
            if (result != map.end() && result->second != i)
                return vector<int> {i, result->second};
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
